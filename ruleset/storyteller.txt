Actions are resolved in the Storyteller System by rolling a <b>pool</b> of ten-sided dice, with the number of dice determined by one or more of a character's traits. 
        
<b>Each action has a number that each die must meet; this number is either called a difficulty (in the World of Darkness games and Street Fighter) or a target number (in the Revised Storyteller System)</b>. 

This number is usually 7, although some World of Darkness games instead use a baseline difficulty of 6. 

Any dice that come up as this number or higher are counted as successes; in some versions, each die showing a result of 1 actually subtracts a success. The more successes, the more favourable the result.
